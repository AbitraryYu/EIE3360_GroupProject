# What is this?
A VR UnityProject from my bachelors. 



## Structure

The folder contains the source code of our project. I am in charge of the Boolean operations and sandbox building logic.



The `.pdf` file is the summary of our program flow.

# Requirements

1. Leap Motion
2. A microphone
3. A powerful computer (preferably desktop with GPU)
